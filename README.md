# project2_ML

Requirements:

First, if you don't have the libraries: Suprise (scikit-surprise) and future, you need to install them. We propose you a script (intall_libraries.sh) in order to run the following commands:
	$ pip install scikit-surprise
	$ pip install surprise # This is in order the first one 			don't work (we experienced this on Windows)	
	$ pip install future

Warning: if you are on linux or macOS you first need to run: 
	$ chmod +x install_libraries.sh
and then you can run the script with: ./install_libraries.sh

Or you can run the previous command by yourself if you prefer. Or you can look the instructions given on this website for Surprise: http://surpriselib.com/

WARNING: if you are on Windows you may need to install visual studio (you can do this here: http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools
(The 2015 version is enough, and you need to install the SDK which is proposed in the installation)
