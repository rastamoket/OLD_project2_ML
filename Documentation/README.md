Requirements
================

Install Libraries
-------------------

First, if you don't have the libraries: Suprise (scikit-surprise) and future, you need to install them. We propose you a script (intall_libraries.sh) in order to run the following commands:
	$ pip install scikit-surprise

	$ pip install surprise # This is in order the first one don't work (we experienced this on Windows)

	$ pip install future


Or you can run the previous command by yourself if you prefer. 
Or you can look the instructions given on these websites: for Surprise: http://surpriselib.com/ and for future: http://python-future.org/quickstart.html

WARNINGS
------------------

If you are on Windows you may need to install visual studio, you can do this here: http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools
(The 2015 version is enough, and you need to install the SDK which is proposed in the installation)

If you are on linux or macOS you first need to run: 

	$ chmod +x install_libraries.sh

and then you can run the script with: ./install_libraries.sh
